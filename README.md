# sbotest

**[sbotest](https://pghvlaans.github.io/sbotools/sbotest/)** is a reverse dependency build tester based on the **[sbotools](https://pghvlaans.github.io/sbotools/)** library.

This **sbotools** extension was written with script maintainers in mind: Easily build and test scripts with all reverse dependencies, the first level of reverse dependencies or no reverse dependencies with a single command. See the man page for more information about options and settings.

**sbotest** was designed and intended to be run in a build-testing environment, such as a virtual machine or a Docker image. Using **sbotest** on a general-purpose Slackware installation is **unsupported** and **unadvisable**.
