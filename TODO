A few more things to do before a version release:

* Handle incompatible sbotools installations more cleanly.
* Make sure the man page and README.md are ready to go.
* Release sbotools-3.7 (a compatible release is needed before anyone
  who doesn't install from sbotools-git-slackbuild can use this).
