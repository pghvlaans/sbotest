sbotest-1.2 TODO

* Add an option to test everything.

  This will take the contents of the archive directory into account.
  Everything in the repo that isn't archived (and up-to-date) or
  incompatible will be a test target.

* Make --single work with non-SBO packages in the dependency chain.

  Done. This required some improvements for --noinstall on the
  sbotools side and strengthening sbotest protection for potential
  stock packages.
