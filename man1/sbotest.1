.SH DISCLAIMER
.P
.B
sbotest
is designed and intended to run in a clean build-testing environment,
such as a virtual machine or a
.B
Docker
image. Missing users and groups are added automatically when running
.B
sbotest\fR\
\&, and any packages installed as a result of testing are removed
afterwards unless they had been previously installed.
.P
Using
.B
sbotest
on a general-purpose Slackware installation is
.B
unsupported
and
.B
unadvisable\fR\
\&.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B
sbotest
is a reverse dependency build tester based on the
.B
sbotools
library. To fetch or update the repository before testing, call
.B
sbotest pull\fR\
\&. Select a git branch and repository URL by editing
.I
/etc/sbotest/sbotest.conf
or, temporarily, by passing
.B
--git-branch
and
.B
--repo\fR\
\&.
.B
sbotest
is also configurable at the command line with
.B
config\fR\
\&, and per-script hints can be applied with
.B
hints\fR\
\&. See
.B
sboconfig(1)
and
.B
sbohints(1)
for more details.
.P
Called without options,
.B
sbotest
builds any requested
SlackBuilds with their first level of reverse dependencies.
Use
.B
sbotest find --first-reverse
or pass
.B
--dry-run
for a list of scripts that would be tested, if compatible.
To test all reverse dependencies of the requested scripts,
use the
.B
--full-reverse
option;
.B
--single
tests no reverse dependencies. Please note that already-installed
scripts can be tested only with
.B
--single\fR\
\&; the existing package on the system is not replaced.
.P
Each test target has a separate testing workflow. First,
dependencies saved to the
.B
SBO_ARCHIVE
directory (default
.I
/usr/sbotest/archive\fR\
\&) are installed to save time; see
.B
CONFIGURATION
below for details. Any missing users and groups are added, and
.B
sboinstall(1)
is called.
.P
Newly-built packages are saved to a timestamp-appended
.B
PKG_DIR\fR\
\&. By default, any dependencies (not test targets) built are saved to
.B
SBO_ARCHIVE
for future use; to change this, see
.B
--no-archive
and
.B
--archive-force
below. Any packages that are not required for the following build
are removed afterwards. Packages without the
.I
_SBo
tag are unaffected, and no package that is already installed when
.B
sbotest
starts can be removed or reinstalled.
.P
.B
sbopkglint(1)
is run on all test targets once
.B
sboinstall(1)
has been called for the last time. A summary of results is
displayed and saved to
.I
SBO_HOME/results/(timestamp).log\fR\
\&. Scripts that fail
.B
sbolint(1)
or
.B
sbopkglint(1)\fR\
\&, or fail to build altogether, are reported so that any
issues can be taken care of before submitting scripts to
.B
SlackBuilds.org\fR\
\&.
.P
To generate a report of potential operations,
use
.B
--dry-run
with any combination of other options.
.P
Non-root users can run sbotest with
.B
--help\fR\
\&,
.B
--version
and
.B
--dry-run.
.B
hints\fR\
\&,
.B
config
and
.B
find
can be run by anyone with listing-related options.

.SH TESTING STRATEGIES
There are three basic ways to test scripts with
.B
sbotest\fR\
\&. After using
.B
sbotest pull
to retrieve a new branch or the latest updates:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3n
Test against the upstream repository without changes.
.IP \[bu] 3n
Test against a git
branch with changes to be merged.
.IP \[bu] 3n
Test against the upstream repository with changes in a
local overrides directory.
.RE
.P
The first case is the simplest, and requires no configuration
beyond setting
.B
RSYNC_DEFAULT
or
.B
REPO
in
.I
/etc/sbotest/sbotest.conf
as appropriate.
.P
To test upcoming changes in a git branch, set
.B
GIT_BRANCH
to the name of the branch and ensure that
.B
REPO
is set if non-default. Alternatively, specify with the
.B
--repo
and
.B
--git-branch
options when running
.B
sbotest pull\fR\
\&. From here, run
.B
sbotest\fR\
\&. If multiple scripts are to be tested for submission,
using a single merged branch for testing may be convenient:
.RS

 git branch testbranch
 git checkout testbranch
 git merge rust-opt dos2unix fvwm3
 git push --set-upstream origin testbranch


.RE
.P
To use a local overrides directory, set
.B
LOCAL_OVERRIDES
to an absolute path. Place directories for any script to be
tested in the top level and run
.B
sbotest\fR\
\&. Removing these directories when testing is complete is advisable.
.P
Reusing built packages in future test runs saves time and resources.
The default archive directory is
.I
/usr/sbotest/archive\fR\
\&; packages stored here are reinstalled in lieu of building
when needed, provided they are up-to-date. During an
.B
sbotest
run, all built dependencies are archived by default. To archive
all built packages (including testing targets), use
.B
--archive-force\fR\
\&. Ignore the archive altogether with
.B
--no-archive\fR\
\&.
.P
The archive can be kept current with
.B
--archive-rebuild\fR\
\&. This rebuilds all version- and build-mismatched packages in the
archive, provided that they are not installed or on the blacklist.
If
.B
STRICT_UPGRADES
is
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&, only mismatched packages with lower version or build numbers are
removed from the archive. By default, all mismatched packages are removed.
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
The default configuration directory is
.I
/etc/sbotest
with files
.I
sbotest.conf\fR\
\&,
.I
sbotest.hints
and
.I
obsolete
being recognized.
.I
obsolete
is relevant only if testing against Slackware -current. To use
an alternative configuration directory, set an environment
variable
.I
SBOTEST_CONF_DIR\fR\
\&.
.P
Configuration options and hints can be set from the command line with
.B
config
and
.B
hints\fR\
\&, respectively.
.P
Several default settings differ from base
.B
sbotools\fR\
\&:
.P
.B
ETC_PROFILE
.RS
With a default of
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&, source all executable scripts of the form
.I
*.sh
in
.I
/etc/profile
before building each script.
.RE
.P
.B
CPAN_IGNORE
.RS
With a default of
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&, build and install SlackBuilds regardless of
whether they have been installed from the CPAN.
.RE
.P
.B
SBO_HOME
.RS
The default value is
.I
/usr/sbotest\fR\
\&.
.RE
.P
.B
PKG_DIR
.RS
The default value is
.I
SBO_HOME/tests\fR\
\&. Unless an
.B
absolute path
is specified, packages built during the test run are saved
to a timestamp-designated directory under that path, e.g.
.I
/usr/sbotest/tests/2025-05-31-16:27-tests\fR\
\&.
.RE
.P
.B
LOG_DIR
.RS
The default value is
.I
SBO_HOME/logs\fR\
\&. Unless an
.B
absolute path
is specified, log files are saved to a timestamp-designated
directory under that path.
.RE
.P
.B
SBO_ARCHIVE
.RS
This setting is used only when running
.B
sbotest\fR\
\&, and has a default value of
.I
SBO_HOME/archive\fR\
\&. Any packages stored here are installed prior to calling
.B
sboinstall(1)\fR\
\&, provided that they:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3n
Are not test targets.
.IP \[bu] 3n
Are required by the script to be tested.
.IP \[bu] 3n
Are not already installed.
.IP \[bu] 3n
Have versions and build numbers matching the local repository.
.RE
.P
The archive can be kept in sync with the local repository by running
.B
sbotest
with
.B
--archive-rebuild\fR\
\&.
.RE
.P
Hints may be specified in
.I
/etc/sbotest/sbotest.hints\fR\
\&. Saved build options from
.B
sbotools
are ignored. See
